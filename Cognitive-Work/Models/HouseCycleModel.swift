/// One division cycle of a house: the days a chore division covers.
///
/// Written by ``TaskSchedulerEngine/schedule(chores:users:)`` every time it generates a division,
/// so the end of a cycle is read instead of guessed. Everything that depends on "which cycle is
/// this" uses ``key``: coin payouts, the rank history, and coupon purchases.
///
/// Rules:
/// - A cycle covers `startDate...endDate`, both days included.
/// - The **latest** cycle is the one with the most recent start. Coupons bought now belong to it.
/// - A cycle is **closed** once today is after its `endDate`; closed cycles get paid.
/// - Generating a division before the latest cycle ended cuts that cycle short: it ends the day
///   before the new one starts.
