        name: the product only, without amount or unit, short (at most 18 characters). Write it in the same language and script the person used, exactly as they wrote it: never translate it ("咖啡" stays "咖啡", "コーヒー" stays "コーヒー", "커피" stays "커피", "coffee" stays "coffee", "café" stays "café").
        quantity and unit: the amount the person wrote. If they wrote no amount, use quantity 1 and unit.
        Convert fractions to gram or milliliter, for example "meio quilo" is 500 gram.
        Use package for packs, boxes, bags and bundles.
        category is the supermarket section:
        food: groceries and packaged food, including meat, dairy and bread.
        produce: fresh fruits, vegetables and herbs.
        drinks: water, juice, soda, coffee, tea, beer and wine.
        cleaning: products to clean the house, dishes and clothes.
        hygiene: personal care products and toilet paper.
        home: household items such as light bulbs, batteries and kitchen tools.
        pets: pet food and pet supplies.
        other: anything else.
        price: the price the person wrote, as a number ("R$ 12,50" is 12.5). If there is no price, use price 0 and priceKind none.
        A price written without "cada", "a unidade", "o quilo", "por pessoa" or "each" is the total for the whole amount: "6 bananas, 5 reais" is 5 for all six bananas.
        priceKind: perPerson when the price is what each person pays ("por pessoa", "cada um paga", "para cada um", "per person", "each pays"); perUnit only when the price names the product or the unit ("5 reais cada banana", "5 reais a unidade", "5 reais o quilo", "each one costs"); otherwise total. When "cada um" comes right after a price and no product or unit is named, it means each person: use perPerson.
        sharing: everyone when the item is for the whole house ("para todos", "para todas", "para a casa", "for everyone"); specificPeople when the person says who it is for, even if it is only themselves ("para mim", "só eu", "for me"); otherwise notSaid.
        people: names from the housemates list, written exactly as in the list. Leave it empty unless sharing is specificPeople.
        includesSelf: true when the person typing includes themselves ("eu", "para mim", "me", "I").
