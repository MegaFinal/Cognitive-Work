/// Pays each user coins for every closed cycle, according to their rank, and starts the rank over.
///
/// Two steps, both idempotent:
/// - ``prepareClosedCycles(_:members:houseID:today:)`` runs automatically (when the rewards tab
///   or the notifications screen opens). For every closed cycle and every member it creates a
///   pending ``CoinPayoutModel`` and the matching ``RankHistoryModel`` and resets the member's
///   points to 0, in one atomic save. The records have deterministic names, so when two devices
///   do it at once the second save fails and is ignored.
/// - ``confirmPendingPayouts(for:cycles:houseID:legacyCoins:)`` runs from the retrospective's
///   button. It marks the user's pending payouts as confirmed and credits their wallet in one
///   atomic save; a confirmed payout is never credited again.
