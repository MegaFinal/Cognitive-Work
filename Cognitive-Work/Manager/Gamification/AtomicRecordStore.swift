/// The two operations the coin and coupon flows need from CloudKit, so their concurrency rules
/// can be tested without a server.
///
/// CloudKit has no transactions, so every flow follows the same optimistic pattern:
/// 1. ``fetch(_:)`` the records involved. Each fetched `CKRecord` carries the server's change tag.
/// 2. Check the business rules on those values and change the records.
/// 3. ``saveAtomically(_:)`` all of them in one request.
///
/// The save succeeds only if **no** record changed on the server since it was fetched, and a
/// record created locally (no change tag) does not exist yet. Otherwise nothing is written and
/// ``AtomicRecordStoreError/conflict`` is thrown: the caller fetches again and re-checks the
/// rules. Deterministic record names turn "does not exist yet" into a uniqueness constraint.
///
/// Deletes are deliberately not offered: CloudKit does not check change tags on deletes, so they
/// can't take part in this pattern. Records expire by being overwritten instead.
